## Description

Genisum is an impressive application using ReactJS with Vite for quick and efficient setup. The user interface stands out with its responsive and appealing design, achieved through Tailwind CSS and a touch of glass morphism. With RTK Query, I have made advanced API requests and managed history using local storage. Additionally, the project has an effective form event handling and error capturing, along with the copy-to-clipboard functionality. Throughout the development process, I have prioritized clean code practices, ensuring high-quality development.
